# MONGODB-CURD-OPERATIONS
   DESCRIPTION
   
    It demonstrates a basic web application example that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
    operations using MongoDB as the database.

   PREREQUISTIES
   
      Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

      MongoDB: A NoSQL database system
      A web server or framework capable of handling HTTP requests (e.g., Express.js for Node.js)
   

   DEPENDENCIES
          
          Node.js
          express.js
          mongodb
          
  HOW TO RUN
  
           npm install
  Set up a connection to your MongoDB database. This can be done by configuring the connection details in a separate file or
  directly in the code. Ensure you have the necessary credentials (e.g., host, port, username, password) to connect to your MongoDB instance.

Modify the code as needed to match your database connection settings. Look for sections of code that handle the MongoDB connection and update them accordingly.

Start the web server,using:

          npm start
Ensure the server starts without any errors.
Access the application in your web browser by navigating to the appropriate URL (e.g., http://localhost:1234).


EXPLANATION FOR HTML CODE

     The  code is written in HTML,css.


HTML STRUCTURE

         The code begins with the standard HTML structure. 

         The <body> section contains the main content of the page.

PAGE TITLE AND HEADING

         The <h1>element displays the title of the page,that is,"COLLEGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM". 
  
  
CREATE OPERATION
  
         The code checks if the edit_id variable is present or not,if present the page displays an edit form. Otherwise,
         it displays a create form.
  

EDIT FORM
  
          If the edit_id variable is present, the code displays an edit form. 

  
  INPUT FIELDS
  
         name
         register number
         class
  

STUDENT LIST
  
          The code uses a loop ({{#each StudDet}}) to iterate over a list of students.

         for each student, it generates an <li> element containing the student name,rollno,class. It also includes two links:
         "Edit" and "Delete". The "Edit"       link includes the StudDet _id as a query parameter (edit_id={{this._id}})
          to identify which student to edit. The "Delete" link includes the studDet_id as a query parameter (delete_id={{this._id}}).
          It also includes an onclick event to show a confirmation dialog before deleting the student detail.

SYNTAX
  
    The code uses a templating language (not specified in the code snippet) to insert dynamic values into the HTML. 
    The placeholders ({{message}}, {{#if edit_id}}, {{edit_id}}, {{edit_StudDet.name}}, {{editStudDet.rollno}},
    {{editStudDet.cls}} {{#each StdDet}}, {{this.name}}, {{this.rollno}}`,{{this.cls}}) are replaced with actual 
    values when the page is rendered.

CONCLUSION
  
  This code  demonstrates a basic web application that allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a 
  collection of student details stored in a MongoDB database. It provides forms for creating new student details and editing 
  existing ones,as well as displaying a list of students with options to edit or delete each student.utilizing MongoDB for 
  curd operations in a college management system brings advantages in terms of flexibility, scalability, performance, and data 
  analysis capabilities. It provides an efficient and robust foundation for managing and manipulating data, ensuring the 
  smooth operation of the college management system.
